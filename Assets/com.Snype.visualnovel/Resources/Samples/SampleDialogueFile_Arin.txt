Did you see the latest Hytale footage? The world feels alive - like every biome has a story.
Procedural worlds, deep modding tools, RPG systems... it feels like the game Minecraft always wanted to become.
Exactly! If they nail exploration and storytelling, this could be something special.
That's my concern too. Hype has crushed better projects.
